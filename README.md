# Overview

This is the official documentation for Raindrop.io API. A reference to the functionality our public API provides with detailed description of each API endpoint, parameters, and examples.

### Request and response format

API endpoints accept arguments either as url-encoded values for non-POST requests or as json-encoded objects encoded in POST request body with `Content-Type: application/json` header.

This API relies on standard HTTP response codes to indicate operation result. The table below is a simple reference about the most used status codes:

| Status code | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| 200 |  |
| 204 |  |
| 4xx |  |
| 5xx |  |
