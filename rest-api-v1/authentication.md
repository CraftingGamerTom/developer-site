# Authentication

In order to make authorized calls to Raindrop.io APIs, your application must first obtain an access token from the users or use your [personal API token](https://raindrop.io). This section describes the different ways of obtaining such a token.

For the sake of simplicity we decided to not list the token on every parameter table but please note that the **token is required for every resource**.

Note that we encourage your application to use the [OAuth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth) protocol to obtain the access token from the user.
